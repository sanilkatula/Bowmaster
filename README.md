## Features

- **Arrow Physics**: Simulates realistic arrow flight and interactions with the environment.
- **Collision Management**: Handles events when arrows collide with objects, including changes in physical properties and triggering of events.
- **Object Interaction**: Scripts allow objects to follow targets or move along predefined paths, enhancing the game's dynamic environment.
- **Audio Feedback**: Provides auditory cues for actions like hitting the target, adding an immersive layer to the gameplay.
- **Target Mechanism**: Targets are equipped with color-coded tags for precise collision detection, providing immediate feedback when hit by an arrow. This feature enhances gameplay interactivity and feedback accuracy.
- **Bow Mechanism**: Features an undroppable bow that stays in the air when not held, accommodating both left-handed and right-handed players. Arrows appear on the bow ready to be shot, enhancing realism and ease of use.


## Script Summary

### ArrowScripts
- `FlyStraight.cs`: Controls the arrow's flight, ensuring it points in the direction it's moving.
- `NonKineCollision.cs`: Makes arrows kinematic upon collision and triggers collision-related events.
- `RandomAudioPlayer.cs`: Plays random audio clips, used for various sound effects in the game.

### BowScripts
- Manage the bow's interactions, such as how it can be grabbed, aiming mechanisms, and visual orientation relative to the player and targets.

## Gulf Analysis Overview

### Gulf of Execution
- Users faced challenges in understanding how to interact with the game environment, such as picking up and using the bow. Solutions implemented include step-by-step instructions and intuitive control enhancements.

### Gulf of Evaluation
- The game now includes clear audio feedback and a scoring system to help users evaluate their performance, such as knowing when the arrow hits the target or specific parts of the target, aiding in immediate performance feedback.

### System/User Interface Adjustments
- Modifications were made to improve system response to user inputs, making the controls more intuitive and reducing confusion between similar commands.

### Feedback Mechanisms
- Enhanced feedback mechanisms help users understand the results of their actions better, with audio cues and visual aids that clarify the impact and accuracy of their shots.

By addressing these gulfs, the game's usability and player engagement have significantly improved, making for a more intuitive and enjoyable user experience.
